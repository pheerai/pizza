Ever wanted to share a pizza (or else) to anyone who offers a service, for example hosts a data sharing service?

With PIZZA, you may now send pizza (or else) to any mailaddress out there!

Usage: You need a running mail-service on your system (i.e. a postfix configured to use a smarthost).
To run "pizza" from the bare repository, cd into the src directory and run

export PIZZAINC="../assets"; ./pizza
